<p>Hi, I'm Rahul Patil, living in Pune (India). I've been developing for the web since 2010,
moving from writting small ruby programs, static HTML to <b>Ruby on Rails.</b>

This is my blog where I share about software development.
Whenever I have the chance, I set aside a few minutes to share what Iâ€™m learning here on the <a href="{{ site.url }}"> {{ site.title }} </a>.

Thanks for reading!
