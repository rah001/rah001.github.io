<p>Hi, I'm Rahul Patil, living in Pune (India). I've been developing for the web since 2010,
moving from writting small ruby programs, static HTML to <b>Ruby on Rails.</b> This is my software development blog.
In my blog, <a href="{{ site.url }}"> {{ site.title }} </a>, I show how simple & short quick pointers will help you while developing software application.</p>

<!-- In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
